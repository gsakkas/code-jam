Google Code Jam
==================

Here are some of my solutions for [Google's Code Jam](https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam/ "Google's Code Jam") programming competition.

You can also find some Python and Haskell templates for reading/writing the inputs/outputs as needed for Code Jam.
There is also a program that can help you run different testcases of one input file in parallel.

All solutions are written by me and the input files are the ones given from Google Code Jam competition.
